# Akita Utils

[![CI](https://github.com/Fudenberg-Research-Group/akita_utils/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Fudenberg-Research-Group/akita_utils/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Awesome akita_utils created by Fudenberg-Research-Group: [Fudenberg Team](https://fudenberg.team/)

## Description

Akita Utils is a set of functions for the analysis of Akita.V2 predictions. Akita is a deep learning CNN model that predicts contact frequency maps from the DNA sequence. This repository includes scripts and tools to efficiently analyze model's predictions.

Scripts used for cross-species AkitaV2 training and model weights are available from the [Basenji repository](https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master/manuscripts/akita/v2).

Akita Utils has been used to perform experiments on extracting sequence contributions of CTCF to genome folding. The code for these experiments and computational analysis of Akita.V2â€™s predictions can be found in the [akitaX1-analyses repository](https://github.com/Fudenberg-Research-Group/akitaX1-analyses).

Preprint available here: *link to be added very soon*
