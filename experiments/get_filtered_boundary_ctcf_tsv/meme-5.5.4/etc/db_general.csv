alu,yes,yes,yes,ALU,Alu repeats from REPBASE; suitable for masking Alu repeats from query sequences.  It used to be available by anonymous FTP from ncbi.nih.gov (under the /pub/jmc/alu directory).

epd,no,yes,yes,EPD,The <a href="https://epd.expasy.org/epd">Eukaryotic Promoter Database</a> is an annotated non-redundant collection of eukaryotic POL II promoters for which the transcription start site has been determined experimentally. Access to promoter sequences is provided by pointers to positions in nucleotide sequence entries. The annotation part of an entry includes description of the initiation site mapping data; cross-references to other databases; and bibliographic references. EPD is structured in a way that facilitates dynamic extraction of biologically meaningful promoter subsets for comparative sequence analysis. This database contains 4806 promoters from several species.
